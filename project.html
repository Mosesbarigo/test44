     <h1> Eight (8) in 1 Double Classroom Project</h1>
     
    <p>Our major project for 2024 is the construction of an 8-in-1 Double Classroom to replace the current makeshift classrooms. In 2017, a local Building Board visited the school and condemned the entire set of buildings, leading to a six-week suspension of school activities. Demolition work soon began, and the School Board of Management mobilized resources to construct 19 makeshift classrooms, accommodating an average of 1,200 students. To address the situation long-term, the school developed a 5-year strategic plan to build permanent structures, which would replace the makeshift classrooms once they were condemned. In 2019, a timely donation from Hon. John Rosso facilitated the construction of a modernized 8-in-1 Double Classroom, which was opened in 2020.
    After the makeshift classrooms were completed in 2018, the School Board of Management implemented the 5-year strategic plan, successfully saving a substantial amount of money from the Project Fee collections. According to this plan, the construction of permanent buildings was set to begin in 2024.</p>

    <h1> Financial Constraints</h1>
        <p>In 2024, the school plans to move forward with the construction of the 8-in-1 Double Classroom; however, it faces a shortfall of 30% of the total project cost. This gap is due to the non-payment of Project Fees, largely influenced by the Government's Tuition Fee-Free policy. Despite these challenges, the Board proceeds with alternative plans to raise the necessary funds to cover the remaining balance.<br><br>
        Amonst options to raise funds, the BoM organises fund raising Dinner to kick start the fundraising activities.</p>
     <br>
     <h1> 1st Fundraising Dinner</h1>
        <p>Our first Fundraising Dinner was held at the Lae International Hotel on the eve of July 13th 2024. We raised a total of K30,000 (which was much less than expected) from the supporting businesses and organizations. Most companies approached were unable to assist due to cash-flow issues due to the economic instability. In spite of the set-back, the school went ahead with its plan and commits the proceedings raised from the fundraising to Earth works and securing necessary permits to grant approval from the National Building Board to allow construction to proceed. </p>
